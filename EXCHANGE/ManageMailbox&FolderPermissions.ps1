<# Script to Get/Remove mailbox and its folder permissions

*DESCRIPTION:
This simple PS script helps to check and remove permissions of a user on another mailbox or each of its folders.
You can either choose to 'Get' information of the folders that were granted with any access rights or choose to remove the same access rights (on confirmation).
Or choose the other option to check 'Get' and remove(on confirmation) mailbox permissions (delegations) of one user grated over another user mailbox.

Warning: Once confirmed on first prompt while removing permissions, all the selected accesses will be revoked without any further notice on confirmation.
